Crawler
=======

Goal: Build a web crawler using Python, and get fluent in the language.  

This crawler is given as an assigment in the RMIT course [COSC1165 Intelligent Web Systems](http://www.rmit.com/courses/004170)

* Polite: Won't flood servers.
* Efficient: Multithreaded to keep a good throughput when being polite to servers.
* Robust: Handles multiple crawler traps.
* Selective: Can not crawl the whole web. 

### Tradeoffs
*  BFS vs DFS?
